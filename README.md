## ✨ What is Semantic Flow?

Semantic Flow is the first true **Context Engineering Canvas**—a creative environment for structuring complex ideas, systems, and worlds. It moves beyond prompt engineering and worldbuilding, empowering you to visually design, connect, and export intricate workflows using a rich semantic ontology. 

**Context Engineering** is the art and science of shaping, structuring, and managing the information context for agents, systems, and logic. With Semantic Flow, you architect not just prompts, but entire constructs, workflows, and schemas—turning imagination into machine-readable input.

**The Canvas for Your Imagination:**
- **Agentic Systems:** Design behaviors, interactions, and cognitive processes for AI agents and multi-agent worlds.
- **Role-Playing & Scenario Design:** Create dynamic characters, rules, and logic for games, simulations, and collaborative storytelling.
- **Code & Project Structuring:** Map out logic, architectures, and workflows for large codebases and technical projects.
- **Schema Generation:** Instantly convert your thoughts into structured formats (JSON, YAML, XML, Markdown) for downstream use.

**Why Context Engineering?**
Semantic Flow lets you sculpt the context that drives agents, systems, and logic. Whether you’re building a complex agent, a simulated world, a business process, or a legal argument, you’re engineering the context—making your ideas actionable, testable, and interoperable.

### 🎯 Who is Semantic Flow For?
- **AI Engineers & Researchers:** Visually design, debug, and optimize agentic workflows and reasoning systems.
- **Developers & Architects:** Scaffold applications, logic flows, and project structures in a visual environment.
- **Writers, Game Masters, & Scenario Designers:** Create rich, structured narratives, interactive logic, and character-driven systems.
- **Systems Thinkers:** Map, analyze, and optimize complex systems of any kind.

## 🎨 Features

### 🧩 Semantic Ontology: 16+ Clusters, 100+ Node Types
At the heart of Semantic Flow is a deep semantic ontology—organized into clusters representing every facet of logic, reasoning, cognition, and context. Each node type is a building block for your workflows, agents, worlds, or schemas.

| Cluster | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Proposition (PROP)** | Basic truth assertions and statements |
| **Inquiry (INQ)** | Information seeking and problem definition |
| **Hypothesis/Evidence/Method (HEM)** | Scientific method and evidence |
| **Reasoning (RSN)** | Deduction, induction, abduction, analogy |
| **Evaluation Gates (EVL)** | Consistency, validity, and quality checks |
| **Modal & Mental-State (MOD)** | Logic, beliefs, intentions, modalities |
| **Speech-Act Markers (SPA)** | Communication intents and actions |
| **Discourse Meta (DSC)** | Discourse management and annotation |
| **Control & Meta Engines (CTL)** | Flow control, branching, merging |
| **Error/Exception (ERR)** | Error handling, contradiction, recovery |
| **Creative Operations (CRT)** | Brainstorming, combining, insight |
| **Mathematical Reasoning (MTH)** | Mathematical logic, proofs, conjectures |
| **Cognitive Mechanics (COG)** | Planning, goals, evaluation, schema |
| **Mind Constructs (MND)** | Mental and philosophical concepts |
| **Non-Classical Logic (NCL)** | Alternative logic systems |
| **Dynamic Semantics (DYN)** | Context, meaning, and adaptation |
| **Utility (UTIL)** | Metadata, blank nodes, scaffolding |

[Counterarguments] → [Rebuttal] → [Judicial Decision]
```
*Model legal reasoning: organize claims, precedents, statutes, and counterarguments to simulate courtroom logic, automate legal document generation, or support legal research and case analysis.*

### Example 3: Business Decision Making (Context Engineering for Strategy)
```
[Problem Definition] → [Stakeholder Analysis] → [Option Generation]
     ↓                    ↓                      ↓
[Risk Assessment] → [Cost-Benefit Analysis] → [Implementation Plan]
```
*Visualize and optimize business processes: define problems, analyze stakeholders, generate options, assess risks, perform cost-benefit analysis, and plan implementations. Ideal for strategic planning, consulting, and operational management.*

### Example 4: Roleplaying & Scenario Design (Context Engineering for Worlds)
```
[Character Creation] → [World Setting] → [Rule Definition]
     ↓                    ↓               ↓
[Dynamic Events] → [Player Choices] → [Consequence Engine]
     ↓                    ↓               ↓
[Feedback Loops] → [Narrative Arcs] → [Endgame Scenarios]
```
*Define characters, settings, and rules using semantic nodes. Create dynamic interactions and consequences for player actions. Ideal for D&D-style campaigns, collaborative storytelling, or simulation environments.*

## 📋 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: The landing page title appears truncated on mobile**
A: This has been fixed with responsive typography scaling (text-4xl sm:text-5xl md:text-6xl lg:text-7xl)

**Q: I get an infinite loading loop when setting up AI providers**
A: This has been resolved by improving provider configuration in the provider setup

**Q: The landing page doesn't appear**
A: Clear your browser's sessionStorage: `sessionStorage.clear(); location.reload()`


**Q: Node palette appears white in dark mode**
A: Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5) to reload the CSS

**Q: Workflow execution fails**
A: Verify your AI provider API key is valid and has sufficient credits

**Q: Models like 'gpt-4-turbo' don't work**
A: These models have been deprecated. Use the new defaults (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini) or enter custom model names
